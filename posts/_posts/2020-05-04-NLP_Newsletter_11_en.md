Welcome to the 11th issue of the NLP Newsletter. In this issue, we cover topics that range from reinforcement learning frameworks for tax policy design to state-of-the-art conversational AI to improving text generation frameworks.


# dair.ai updates
- We have released a [dataset](https://github.com/dair-ai/emotion_dataset) that can be used for text-based emotion research. The repository includes a [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nwCE6b9PXIKhv2hvbqf1oZKIGkXMTi1X#scrollTo=t23zHggkEpc-) that shows how to fine-tune pretrained BERT models for the task of emotion classification. More recently, a model was fine-tuned on our dataset and [hosted](https://huggingface.co/mrm8488/distilroberta-base-finetuned-sentiment) on HuggingFace which can easily be integrated into an NLP pipeline.
- We recently held our first-ever paper reading session. Over 124 people registered and a huge portion of that group participated in the remote event. The first discussion was on the [T5 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683%27). We are hosting a second session where we will have an in-depth discussion of the paper. All are invited to the event posted [here](https://www.meetup.com/dair-ai/events/270419989/). To find out more about future events, join our [Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/dair-ai), or join the discussion in our [Slack group](https://join.slack.com/t/dairai/shared_invite/zt-dv2dwzj7-F9HT047jIGkunNKv88lQ~g).

***OpenAI‚Äôs Jukebox***

\\
The latest work from OpenAI is called Jukebox which is essentially a neural network architecture trained to generate music (from scratch) in various genres and artistic styles. The model, based on a quantization-based approach called VQ-VAE, is fed genre, artist, and lyrics as input and it outputs a novel audio sample. The idea is to process and compress long raw audio inputs via a multi-level autoencoder and reducing the dimensionality but preserving essential musical information. Thereafter, transformers are used to generate codes that are then reconstructed to raw audio via the VQ-VAE decoder. More details of this work in this [blog post](https://openai.com/blog/jukebox/) or the [full paper.](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/jukebox.pdf)

***HybridQA: A Dataset of Multi-Hop Question Answering over Tabular and Textual Data***

\\
So far, most question answering datasets focus on homogeneous information. [HybridQA](https://github.com/wenhuchen/HybridQA) is a large-scale question answering dataset for encouraging research and methods that require reasoning on heterogeneous information. The (multi-hop) QA dataset consists of a structured Wikipedia table and unstructured information in the form of entities in the table linking to free-form corpora. The authors also discuss two baselines where they highlight the advantages of working with heterogeneous information as opposed to just using the table or text alone. However, they do point out that results are far behind human performance and this calls for QA systems that can better reason over heterogeneous information and address *coverage* problems.

\\
***A state-of-the-art open-source chatbot***

\\
Facebook AI has [built](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/state-of-the-art-open-source-chatbot) and open-sourced Blender, an AI-based model which they refer to as the *largest-ever open-domain chatbot*. Following the success of [Meena](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09977) (a recent conversational AI system proposed by Google), they proposed a model that blends conversational skills like empathy and personality to improve the generated conversation quality. The model was trained using a Transformer-based model (with up to 9.4 billion parameters) on ~1.5 billion training samples. Then it was fine-tuned using a dataset ([Blended Skill Talk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08449)) that aims to provide the identified desirable traits that could improve the conversational abilities of the model. The authors claim that the model is able to generate responses that human evaluators deemed more human than those generated by Meena.

\\
***TLDR: Extreme Summarization of Scientific Documents***

\\
This [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.15011) proposes an approach, including a dataset (SCITLDR), for the novel task of *TLDR generation* of scientific papers. In this work, TLDRs are defined as an alternative and compact summarization of the scientific article. TLDRs, as suggested by the authors, can serve as a way to quickly understand what a paper is about and potentially help the reader decide whether they want to continue reading the paper. Due to variation in human-generated summaries, multiple TLDRs are obtained from experts via a peer review style. A BART-based model with a multitask fine-tuning schedule (including title generation and TLDR generation) was used for the final task.

***WT5?! Training Text-to-Text Models to Explain their Predictions***

\\
*Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer* ([T5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683)) is a method that brings together all the recent improvements in NLP transfer learning models into one unified framework. This work proposes that most NLP tasks can be formulated in a text-to-text format, suggesting that both the inputs and outputs are texts. The authors claim that this ‚Äú*framework provides a consistent training objective both for pre-training and fine-tuning*‚Äù. T5 is essentially an encoder-decoder Transformer that applies various improvements in particular to the attention components of the model. The model was pre-trained on a newly released dataset called [Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/c4) and achieved SOTA results on NLP tasks such as summarization, question answering, and text classification.

\\
New follow-up work called [WT5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14546) (shorthand for ‚ÄúWhy, T5?‚Äù) fine-tunes a Transformer-based T5 model to produce explanations to the predictions it makes. This can help to provide more understanding of why a model is making certain predictions. The model is fed examples with target explanations and with only target labels. The input text, which includes a task prefix (e.g. sentiment) and the actual text can also have an ‚Äúexplain‚Äù tag prepended (see example in the figure below). This enables semi-supervised learning where fully labeled data is provided to the model and only limited examples have the explanation tags. The authors report quantitative and qualitative results demonstrating that their approach achieves state-of-the-art results on explainability datasets including the ability to perform well in out-of-domain data. This work presents an interesting basic model that can be used to better understand the predictions of text-based models but as the authors emphasize the approach is only a surface-level improvement of interpretability and that there is room for improvements.

***What‚Äôs new for Transformers at the ICLR 2020 Conference?***

\\
One of the premier conferences in machine learning, ICLR, had to be held virtually this year due to the travel restrictions imposed by countries all over the world. Being a top conference there is always expectations of novel work, especially improvements on previous works that have been considered groundbreaking. As an example, Transformers have shown to produce state-of-the-art results on a variety of NLP tasks and there were a couple of accepted works at ICLR proposing ways to improve such models.

\\
This [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/whats-new-for-transformers-at-the-iclr-2020-conference-4285a4294792) summarizes some of the works related to Transformers which include architectural revisions (e.g. [ALBERT](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=H1eA7AEtvS), [Reformer](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rkgNKkHtvB), and [Transformer-XH](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=r1eIiCNYwS)), novel learning procedures (e.g. [ELECTRA](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=r1xMH1BtvB) and [Pretrained Encyclopedia](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BJlzm64tDH)), and improving other domains such as large-scale retrieval, text generation, and visual-linguistic representations. One [interesting paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HJlnC1rKPB) even provides a detailed analysis describing the common aspects of self-attention and convolutional layers, with interesting findings suggesting that Transformer architectures are a potential generalization of CNNs.

\\
If you are interested to know more about other works published in ICLR this year, you can check out the [Papers with Code website](https://paperswithcode.com/conference/iclr-2020-1/official) for those papers.

\\
ICLR just made all the [conference talks](https://iclr.cc/virtual_2020/papers.html?filter=keywords) available as open-access.

***The AI Economist: Improving Equality and Productivity with AI-Driven Tax Policies***

\\
Reinforcement learning has allowed AI labs to produce some of the most groundbreaking advancements in the field of AI. In an effort to tackle global problems with AI systems, specifically tax policy design, a group of researchers proposed a reinforcement learning framework ([AI economist](https://blog.einstein.ai/the-ai-economist/)) that aims to learn *dynamic tax policies* purely through simulation and data-driven solutions. Some of the improvements obtained by the AI Economist show promising results and schedules that could lead to a framework that potentially improves social outcomes and the state of economic inequality.

***On bringing common-sense reasoning abilities to AI systems***

\\
It is argued that one of the capabilities lacking in many of today‚Äôs AI systems is common-sense reasoning. This detailed [article](https://www.quantamagazine.org/common-sense-comes-to-computers-20200430/) provides a brief history of this problem and how researchers working on the cutting-edge are beginning to make progress in this aspect of the field. Not surprisingly, many of the recent efforts include the building of knowledge bases to teach a neural network (specifically language models) to learn faster and more efficiently about the world. This can be considered as an effort to combine symbolic reasoning with neural networks to deal with the problems of *coverage* and model *brittleness*.

***Keeping up with the BERTs: a review of the main NLP benchmarks***

\\
What can NLP do better than humans and where is there still room for improvement? In a [recent blog post](https://creatext.ai/blog-posts/nlp-benchmarking-superglue-xtreme), Manuel Tonneau reviews model performance on the GLUE benchmark, identifying tasks where NLP systems excel already and others on which humans still have the lead. The SuperGLUE and XTREME benchmarks are also presented as an initiative to set the bar higher and further motivate research on new tasks and new languages.

***Benchmarking Triton (TensorRT) Inference Server for Transformer Models***

\\
This detailed [blog post](https://blog.einstein.ai/benchmarking-tensorrt-inference-server/) discusses interesting benchmarking experiments for serving Transformer-based language models for production use. The authors use [NVIDIA‚Äôs Triton (TensorRT) Inference Server](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/triton-inference-server-guide/docs/index.html) for hosting the models and experiment with different configurations and setup to provide comparable results between TensorFlow and PyTorch served models. The report includes results obtained on the different aspects of the model serving such as the latency with concurrency, throughput with concurrency, and other configurations involving batch size and sequence length. Many aspects of model serving are missing in the report but the authors are interested in testing with model versioning and different tasks such as object detection. Such guides provide best practices and techniques for benchmarking models that are useful for practitioners putting their models in production.
