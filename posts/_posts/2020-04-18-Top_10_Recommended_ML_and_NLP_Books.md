Note: This is a repost of a [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/omarsar0/status/1214547402838986754?s=20)I posted a month back. Upon several requests, I converted the thread into this Medium post. Enjoy! ðŸ’š

When I went to NeurIPS a couple of months back, I noticed a couple of interesting books that I wanted to share. Here are a few that caught my attention and that I would recommend if you are serious about learning the nitty-gritty of NLP and ML:

There are so many other great books, what others do you recommend?
