# Publications üìô

***Language-specific BERT models***

\\
I have lost count of how many language-specific BERT models there are now but here a couple of the recent releases:

- Dutch BERT ([RobBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06286), [BERTje](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09582))
- [German BERT](https://deepset.ai/german-bert)
- [Portuguese BERT](https://github.com/neuralmind-ai/portuguese-bert)
- French BERT ([CamemBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03894), [FlauBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05372))
- Italian BERT ([AlBERTo](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2481/paper57.pdf), [UmBERTo](https://github.com/musixmatchresearch/umberto))
- Spanish BERT ([BETO](https://github.com/dccuchile/beto))
- Arabic BERT ([araBERT](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KSy89fAkWt6EGfnFQElDjXrBror9lIZh))

\\
Note that most of these models are also being made available through the Hugging Face‚Äôs [Transformer library](https://huggingface.co/models), which was recently upgraded to [2.4.1](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/releases).

\\
***Overly Optimistic Prediction Results on Imbalanced Data: Flaws and Benefits of Applying Over-sampling***

\\
This [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06296) reveals and extensively discusses some of the flaws and benefits of applying over-sampling to deal with imbalanced datasets before partitioning the datasets. Furthermore, the work reproduces previous studies and identifies this methodological flaw that produces overly optimistic results.

\\
***Encode, Tag and Realize: A Controllable and Efficient Approach for Text Generation***

\\
In an effort to reduce the effect of [hallucination](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08684) (producing outputs not supported by input text) common in seq2seq-based text generation methods, a group of Google engineers open-sourced a method for text generation called [LaserTagger](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/01/encode-tag-and-realize-controllable-and.html). The main idea of the method is to produce outputs by tagging words with predicted edit operations (e.g., KEEP, DELETE-ADD, etc.) and applying it to the input words in a so-called *realization* step. This replaces the common text generation method that just generates output from scratch which is generally slow and error-prone. The model offers other benefits besides generating fewer errors, such as enabling the parallel predictions of edit operations while still maintaining good accuracy and outperforming a BERT baseline in scenarios with a smaller number of training examples.

*‚ÄúLaserTagger applied to sentence fusion. The predicted edit operations correspond to deleting ‚Äú. Turing‚Äù and adding ‚Äúand he‚Äù before it. Notice the high overlap between the input and output text.‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî*‚Ää[*source*](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/01/encode-tag-and-realize-controllable-and.html)

\\
***Convolutional Neural Networks as a Model of the Visual System: Past, Present, and Future***

\\
Grace Lindsay released this nice and easy-to-read [report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07092) on the history of CNNs and how they are evaluated as models of biological vision, i.e., how do CNN representations compare to those of the brain? The discussion of the emerging opportunities on the use of CNNs for vision research is highly recommended for readers.

\\
***Multilingual Denoising Pre-training for Neural Machine Translation***

\\
Facebook AI published [mBART](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08210.pdf) a method based on a multilingual seq2seq denoising auto-encoder pretrained on large-scale monolingual corpora for machine translation across 25 languages. This work follows the pretraining scheme of Lewis et al., 2019, BART, and investigates the effects of denoising pretraining on multiple languages such as Korean, Japanese, and Turkish, among other languages. Input text involves the masking of phrases and permuting sentences (noising). A Transformer-based model is learned to reconstruct the text across many languages. The complete autoregressive model is trained only once and can be fine-tuned on any of the language pairs without involving any task-specific or language-specific modifications. Both document-level and sentence-level translation problems are approached. Besides showing performance gains, the authors claim that the method works well on low-resource machine translation.

***On improving conversational agents***

\\
[Meena](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/01/towards-conversational-agent-that-can.html) is a neural conversational agent that aims to conduct improved conversations that are more sensible and specific‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämetrics that are defined to capture important attributes from a human conversation (e.g., fluency). The model learns the conversation context via an encoder and formulates a *sensible* response via the decoder. It is reported that improvement in the quality of conversations was possible by considering more powerful decoders.

# Creativity and Society üé®

***ML tools‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääreading comprehension test and sentiment analyzer***

\\
Ming Cheuk built this [fun app](https://littlealbert.now.sh/#/) that allows you to test the reading comprehension capabilities of a model trained on deep learning methods, in particular, using Google AI‚Äôs language model called [ALBERT](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/12/albert-lite-bert-for-self-supervised.html). ALBERT is a tiny version of BERT for learning language representations. The author explains more about the project and approaches used in this [blog post](https://www.spark64.com/post/machine-comprehension).
Hendrik Strobelt also released a small [project](https://github.com/HendrikStrobelt/sentimenter_minimal_hai) where he shows how to prototype an interactive sentiment analyzer. These are all projects that help to highlight some of the great ideas coming from ML and NLP. If you have a serious and interesting project you are working on, please reach out and we can feature it in the publication/newsletter.

# Tools and Datasets ‚öôÔ∏è

***Free Datasets***

\\
[Google Dataset Search](https://blog.google/products/search/discovering-millions-datasets-web/) is officially out of beta and now provides up to 25 million datasets to search upon. If you ever want inspiration for your next data science or machine learning project, this is the place to find references to datasets hosted all over the internet. It‚Äôs basically a search engine for datasets, this is amazing work and required tremendous effort!

\\
The [Big Bad NLP Database](https://quantumstat.com/dataset/dataset.html) is a website where you can search a dedicated database of over 200 NLP datasets of all types for tasks such as commonsense, sentiment analysis, questions answering, entailment inference, among others.

\\

\\
***Reinforcement learning library***

\\
There are several good reinforcement libraries out there. Recently, Chris Nota developed and released a [PyTorch library](https://github.com/cpnota/autonomous-learning-library) for building reinforcement learning agents based on popular deep RL algorithms such as DQN, PPO, and DDPG, among others. The emphasis of the library is on object-oriented design and for enabling the quick implementation and evaluation of novel reinforcement learning agents.

\\
***ML Explainability and Interpretability***

\\
If you are currently working with text-based language models and want to understand how to interpret them more easily when applied to different language tasks, then you may be interested in [Captum](https://captum.ai/). Captum is an interpretability library that can be used to analyze feature importance, interpreting text and vision models, interpreting multimodal models, and other models such as BERT used for question answering.

\\
If you are interested in model explainability, this [set of tutorials](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/machine-learning-explainability) may also interest you. It includes methods for understanding feature importance via notebooks.

\\
***Machine learning and deep learning libraries***

\\
The Google Research team released [Flax](https://github.com/google-research/flax/tree/prerelease)‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa flexible and powerful neural network library based on [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) which provides a framework for fast computing and training machine learning models using the typical Numpy APIs.

\\

*Flax syntax*

\\
[Thinc](https://thinc.ai/) is a lightweight deep learning library developed by the makers of spaCy. It offers functional-programming APIs for composing, configuring, and deploying custom models built with libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow.

\\
Lyft releases [Flyte](https://eng.lyft.com/introducing-flyte-cloud-native-machine-learning-and-data-processing-platform-fb2bb3046a59) which is a multi-tenant, production-ready, and serverless platform for deploying concurrent, scalable, and maintainable ML and data processing workflows.

\\
***A tool for conversational AI***

\\
The open-source conversational AI framework [DeepPavlov](https://github.com/deepmipt/DeepPavlov) offers a free and easy-to-use solution for building dialogue systems and complex conversational systems. DeepPavlov comes with several predefined components for solving NLP-related problems. It integrates BERT (including conversational BERT) into three downstream tasks: text classification, named entity recognition (and sequence tagging in general), and question answering. As a result, it achieved substantial improvements in all these tasks.

# Ethics in AI üö®

***Facial recognition and privacy***

\\
The New York Times wrote an interesting report on different perspectives of privacy as it relates to facial recognition technology. The focus of this story is around a ‚Äúsecretive company‚Äù called Clearview which allegedly uses AI technology to build universal facial recognition using images scraped from social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, among others. The said technology raises concerns about privacy but it is also claimed to be used mostly for law enforcement. Read more of the story [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html).

\\
***Human-Level AI Progress***

\\
In this [report](https://fortune.com/longform/ai-artificial-intelligence-big-tech-microsoft-alphabet-openai/), Jeremy Kahn extensively discusses the difference between ‚ÄúNarrow AI‚Äù and ‚ÄúGeneral AI‚Äù in the context of the current progress of AI technology. Besides the many topics discussed, lots of questions arise on the returns of (if ever possible) achieving AGI. The report also mentions the recent interest of big tech companies investing in these efforts. Most notably, the report includes several concerns raised by respected researchers claiming the ‚Äúirresponsible and unethical‚Äù behavior displayed by some research organizations that try to manipulate AI narratives for their benefit.

\\
***Privacy-preserving AI technologies***

\\
I am a strong believer in ethical and responsible AI, it‚Äôs not a fad nor is it the time to downplay it, it‚Äôs a serious endeavor that requires the best of minds to get it right. One of the biggest efforts I have witnessed in this aspect of AI is the privacy-persevering efforts from [OpenMined](https://twitter.com/OpenMinedOrg), a community that aims to build more responsible AI tools with privacy as a first-class citizen. If you want to know more, listen to Andrew Trask, lead of this effort, talk more about this initiative in this [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zrU54VIK6k) that is part of the MIT Deep Learning lecture series.

\\
***Understanding AI Ethics and Safety***

\\
Dr. David Leslie published this very [detailed report](https://www.turing.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2019-06/understanding_artificial_intelligence_ethics_and_safety.pdf) on topics that help to better understand AI in the context of ethic and safety. It aims to help developers and researchers better design and implement AI systems for the public sector.

# Articles and Blog posts ‚úçÔ∏è

***Speeding up tokenization tutorial***

\\
Steven van de Graaf wrote this [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-small-timing-experiment-on-the-new-tokenizers-library-a-write-up-7caab6f80ea6) reporting performance gains when using Hugging Face‚Äôs new [Tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers) library as compared to the standard, built-in tokenizer used in [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers). Steven reports 9x speed-up and an implementation that takes 10.6 seconds to tokenize 1 million sentences.

\\
***Can language models really comprehend?***

\\
The Gradient recently featured this [post](https://thegradient.pub/gpt2-and-the-nature-of-intelligence/) by Gary Marcus where he discusses what he believes are fundamental flaws behind language models like GPT-2. The main argument of Gary Marcus is that a model that is trained to be able to predict the next word is not necessarily a model that could understand or reason, i.e., ‚ÄúPrediction is a component of comprehension, not the whole thing.‚Äù He also discusses the importance of innateness in the context of language and argues that the current language models don‚Äôt consider it.

\\
***Curriculum for Reinforcement Learning***

\\
Can designing curriculum-based methods help an RL agent to learn? Lillian Weng [summarizes](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2020/01/29/curriculum-for-reinforcement-learning.html) several curriculum-based approaches and how they can be leveraged to train effective reinforcement learning agents. Weng discusses the challenges of designing an efficient curriculum learning approach which generally requires sorting complexity of tasks and providing the model a sequence of tasks that increase in the level of difficulty during training.

\\
***Introduction to NumPy***

\\
I always recommend anyone that is getting started with machine learning to get plenty of practice with NumPy. A lot of the high-level libraries used for deep learning and machine learning today use NumPy APIs in some way so it‚Äôs a very important tool to understand internally. Anne Bonner recently released this very detailed [tutorial](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/absolute_beginners.html) introducing the basics of NumPy.
