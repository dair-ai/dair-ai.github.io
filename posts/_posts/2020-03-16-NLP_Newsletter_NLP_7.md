Welcome to the 7th issue of the NLP Newsletter. I hope you are having a wonderful day and that you and your loved ones are safe in these difficult times. We decided to publish this newsletter to bring some joy to our readers so please read when you have free time. For now, let‚Äôs keep focused on the things that are of top priority‚Äî our families and friends. ‚ù§Ô∏è üíõ üíö

***A few updates about the NLP Newsletter and dair.ai***
All French and Chinese translations for the previous issues of the NLP Newsletter are now [available](https://github.com/dair-ai/nlp_newsletter). Find out how you can contribute to the translation of previous and upcoming issues of the NLP Newsletter at this [link](https://github.com/dair-ai/dair-ai.github.io/issues/11).

\\
We recently created two GitHub repositories that contain [NLP paper summaries](https://github.com/dair-ai/nlp_paper_summaries) and [PyTorch notebooks](https://github.com/dair-ai/pytorch_notebooks) to get you started with neural networks.


# Research and Publications üìô

***Measuring Compositional Generalization***

\\
In the context of machine learning, compositional generalization is the ability to learn to represent meaning and in turn sequences (novel combinations) from what‚Äôs learned in the training set. To this date, it is not clear how to properly measure compositionality in neural networks. A Google AI team [proposes](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/03/measuring-compositional-generalization.html) one of the largest benchmarks for compositional generalization using tasks such as question answering and semantic parsing. The picture below shows an example of the proposed model using atoms (produce, direct, etc.) to produce novel compounds, i.e., combinations of atoms. The idea of this work is to produce a train-test split that contains examples that share similar atoms (building blocks to generate examples) distribution but different compound distribution (the composition of atoms). The authors claim that is a more reliable way to test for compositional generalization.

***Fine-Tuning Pretrained Language Models: Weight Initializations, Data Orders, and Early Stopping***

\\
Researchers ran a comprehensive [set of fine-tuning trials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06305) to better understand the effect of weight initialization and early stopping in the performance of language models. Through various experiments that involved fine-tuning BERT hundreds of times, it was found that distinct random seeds produce very different results. In particular, the study reports that some weight initialization does perform well across a set of tasks. All the experimental data and trials were publicly released for other researchers that are interested in further understanding different dynamics during fine-tuning.

\\
***Zoom In: An Introduction to Circuits***

\\
OpenAI researchers published a [piece](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/zoom-in/) discussing the state of interpretability of neural networks and the proposal of a new approach to interpreting them. Inspired by cellular biology, the authors delve deep into understanding vision models and what they learn by inspecting the weights of neural networks. Essentially, the study presented a few claims along with collected evidence that they believe could pave the way to better interpret neural networks.

***NLP Research Highlights‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäIssue #1***

\\
In a new dair.ai series called [NLP Research Highlights](https://medium.com/dair-ai/nlp-newsletter-bertology-primer-fastpages-t5-data-science-education-pytorch-notebooks-slow-8ae5d499e040), we provide detailed descriptions of current interesting and important NLP research. This will serve as a way to keep track of NLP progress via approachable summaries of these works. In the first quarterly issue, topics range from improving language models to improving conversational agents to state-of-the-art speech recognition systems. These summaries will also be maintained [here](https://github.com/dair-ai/nlp_paper_summaries).

\\
***Learning to Simulate Complex Physics with Graph Networks***

\\
In the past few months, we have been featuring a lot about Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) due to their effectiveness not only in NLP but in other areas such as genomics and materials. In a recent [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09405), researchers propose a general framework based on graph networks that is able to learn simulations in different domains such as fluids and deformable materials. The authors claim that they achieve state-of-the-art performance across different domains and that their general-purpose approach is potentially the best-learned physics simulator to date. Experiments include the simulation of materials such as goop over water and other interactions with rigid obstacles. They also tested a pre-trained model on out-of-distribution tasks and found promising results that show the generalization of the framework to larger domains.

***Computational predictions of protein structures associated with COVID-19***

\\
DeepMind releases [computationally-predicted structures](https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/computational-predictions-of-protein-structures-associated-with-COVID-19) for proteins linked with the virus related to COVID-19. The predictions are directly obtained from the AlphaFold systems but haven‚Äôt been experimentally verified. The idea with this release is to encourage contributions that aim to better understand the virus and how it functions.

***Court cases that sound like the weirdest fights***

\\
Janelle Shane shares the [results](https://aiweirdness.com/post/612669075940900864/court-cases-that-sound-like-the-weirdest-fights) of a fun experiment where a GPT-2 model is fine-tuned to generate cases against inanimate objects. The model was fed a list of cases where the government was seizing contraband or dangerous goods and it generated cases like the ones shown in the picture below.

***Toward Human-Centered Design for ML Frameworks***

\\
Google AI [published](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/03/toward-human-centered-design-for-ml.html) the results of a large-scale survey of 645 people who used TensorFlow.js. They aimed to find out from non-ML software developers what are the most important features and their overall experience with using current ML frameworks. Findings include that the ‚Äúlack of conceptual understanding of ML‚Äù hinders the use of ML frameworks for this particular set of users. Participants in the study also reported the need for better instructions on how to apply the ML models to different problems and more explicit support for modification.

# Tools and Datasets ‚öôÔ∏è

***NLP Paper Summaries***

\\
We recently created a [repository](https://github.com/dair-ai/nlp_paper_summaries) containing a list of carefully curated NLP paper summaries for some of the most interesting and important NLP papers in the past few years. The focus is to feature paper summaries and blog posts of important papers to help improve the approachability and accessibility of NLP topics and research.

***A differentiable computer vision library for PyTorch.***

\\
[Kornia](https://github.com/kornia/kornia) is an open-source library built on top of PyTorch that allows researchers to use a set of operators for performing differentiable computer vision using PyTorch. Some capabilities include image transformations, depth estimation, and low-level image processing, to name a few. It is heavily inspired by OpenCV but the difference is that it is meant to be used for research as opposed to building production-ready applications.

***Introducing DIET: state-of-the-art architecture that outperforms fine-tuning BERT and is 6X faster to train***

\\
DIET (Dual Intent and Entity Transformer) is a natural language understanding (NLU) multitask architecture [proposed](https://blog.rasa.com/introducing-dual-intent-and-entity-transformer-diet-state-of-the-art-performance-on-a-lightweight-architecture/) by Rasa. The framework focuses on multitask training to improve results on both intent classification and entity recognition. Other benefits of DIET include the ability to use any of the current pre-trained embeddings such as BERT and GloVe. However, the focus was to provide a model that improves the current state-of-the-art performance on those tasks and is faster to train (6X speedup reported). The model is available in the [Rasa Open Source python library](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/1.8.0/nlu/components/#dietclassifier).
