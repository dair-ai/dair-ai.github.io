Note: This is a repost of a [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/omarsar0/status/1214547402838986754?s=20)I posted a month back. Upon several requests, I converted the thread into this Medium post. Enjoy! 💚

Finally, I would also recommend the ebook I put together with [@soujanyaporia](https://twitter.com/soujanyaporia): **[Modern Deep Learning Techniques Applied to Natural Language Processing](https://nlpoverview.com/)**. We are working on improving and updating it. Here is the GitHub repo if you are interested in contributing:
