ðŸŽ‰ Happy new year to all!

\\
We have so many exciting new announcements and events for our community. To start the new year, we are happy to announce our new [**Discord channel**](https://discord.gg/SKgkVT8BGJ). 

\\
The idea is to create an inclusive and vibrant community of learners, researchers, and developers in the AI space. Itâ€™s dedicated to learning, asking questions, discussing, and sharing all the exciting trends and developments in machine learning and AI.

\\
See you there!
