This is an oral presentation I delivered in Brussels, Belgium at the EMNLP 2018 conference for the paper ["CARER: Contextualized Affect Representations for Emotion Recognition"](https://aclanthology.coli.uni-saarland.de/papers/D18-1404/d18-1404)


## Abstract
\\
Emotions are expressed in nuanced ways, which varies by collective or individual experiences, knowledge, and beliefs. Therefore, to understand emotion, as conveyed through text, a robust mechanism capable of capturing and modeling different linguistic nuances and phenomena is needed. We propose a semi-supervised, graph-based algorithm to produce rich structural descriptors which serve as the building blocks for constructing contextualized affect representations from text. The pattern-based representations are further enriched with word embeddings and evaluated through several emotion recognition tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on emotion recognition tasks.
